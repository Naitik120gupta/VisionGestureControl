# 🤖 GestureScroll  
### Hand Gesture Controlled Instagram Reels Scroller

GestureScroll is a **computer vision–based automation project** that allows users to scroll through Instagram Reels using **hand gestures only** — no mouse, no keyboard, just a webcam and real-time gesture recognition.

This project demonstrates how **human–computer interaction (HCI)** can be enhanced using **touchless controls** powered by AI and computer vision.
